## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

In completing this challenge, I learned how to

- move HTML elements using the relative value of the CSS position property

- define a responsive grid using Bootstrap 5, e.g., 

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row g-0">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <div class="..."></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <div class="..."></div>
      </div>
    </div>
```

- use a media query to create a device breakpoint, e.g., 

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 620px) {
  ...  
}
```
### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) - Reading this webpage helped me define a responsive grid.
- [W3Schools Typical Device Breakpoints](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp) - This is where I found the code snippet I needed to define a device breakpoint.
- [GPick](http://www.gpick.org/) - I used this tool to determine onscreen colours.
